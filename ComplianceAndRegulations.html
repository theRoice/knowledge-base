            <h1>Compliance and Regulation</h1>
            <p>
                Compliance and regulation is a broad topic refering to and laws, standards, and guidelines that
                businesses are compelled to follow. These regulations are designed to protect businesses, consumers,
                and the relating infrastructure and data. These requirements vary drastically depending on the location
                of the business, the type of business that is run, and the data that is stored and processed.

                <h2>Data Protection Regulations</h2>
                <p>
                    Regulatory bodies protect end users by ensuring that consumer data is handled responsibly and
                    securely.
                    The major regulator bodies in America include the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of
                    Health and
                    Human Services (HHS), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Payment Card Industry
                    (PCI).
                    Businesses
                    may also be subject to state level regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
                    Any
                    businesses
                    operating internationally may also find themselves subject to the General Data Protection Regulation
                    (GDPR). These
                    should serve as the backbone of any business' compliance and regulation strategy, which should, in
                    turn,
                    inform good policy.
