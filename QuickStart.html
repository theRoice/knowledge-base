            <h1>Quick Guide</h1>
            <p>
                Cyber security is as broad of a topic as it is deep. This page serves as a central location so that you can find the core
                principles and ideas behind cyber security that will help keep your business and your customers safe.

                <h3>Windows and Windows Defender</h3>
                <p>
                    Windows is ubiquitous in the business world and comes pre-installed with Windows Defender,
                    a built-in antivirus and anti-malware solution. Windows defender provides real-time protection
                    to the computer and is a great first line of defense against malware and other threats.
                    It is important to keep Windows and Windows Defender up to date to ensure that you have the latest security patches and features.
                    Windows provides good resources to help you get started with Windows Defender.

                <h3>Apple and Viruses</h3>
                <p>
                    Apple computers are generally considered to be more secure than their Windows counterparts, but this does not mean that they 
                    cannot be compromised. Apple computers can still be infected with viruses and malware, so it is equally important to keep them up to
                    date and to safely and effectively use anti-virus and anti-malware software. Apple recommends using the App Store while making use of
                    its security suite (App Store, Gatekeeper, Notarization, XProtect) Apple outlines a three layer defense strategy to help users
                    keep their computers safe to include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prevent launch or execution of malicious code</li>
                        <li>Block malware from running on systems</li>
                        <li>Remediate malware that has been executed</li>

                    </ul>
                    More info can be found on Apple's website.

            <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
            <div id="pii-info">
                <p> Personally identifiable information is any information that can be used to identify and individual. 
                    This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and much more.
                </p>
                <h3>Protecting PII</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to safe guard PII to protect your customers and business. This can be done a number of ways and can be defined by a policy
                    that is followed by all employees. Some common ways to protect PII include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limiting access to PII to only those who need it</li>
                        <li>Regularly monitoring and auditing access to PII</li>
                        <li>Training employees on how to handle PII securely</li>
                        <li>Encrypting PII when it is stored or transmitted</li>
                        <li>Using strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect accounts that access PII</li>
                        < li>Physical security to include door and cabinet locks, security cameras, and badge access</li>
                        <li>Ensuring availability of PII through the use of backups</li>
                    </ul>
                    The Department of Homeland Security has a guide on how to safeguard PII that is a good resource for small businesses.

            <h2>Email Security</h2>
            <div id="phishing-info">
                <h3>Phishing</h3>
                <p> 
                    Email is a common vector for cyber attacks. Among these attacks phishing is one of the most common avenues of approach.
                    Phishing is a technique used by attackers to trick users into providing PII, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
                    Some common ways to protect against phising attacks include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Training employees to recognize phishing emails</li>
                        <li>Using email filtering software to block phishing emails</li>
                        <li>Regularly monitoring and auditing email accounts for suspicious activity</li>
                        <li>Implementing multi-factor authentication for email accounts</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
                <p>
                    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification before accessing an account or resource.
                    These forms of identification can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a phone or security token), or something the 
                    user is (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition). Any combination of these can be used to provide an additional layer of security to accounts and resources.
                    MFA is an effective way to protect against unauthorized access to accounts and resources, as it makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain access even if they 
                    have the user's password.
                </p>
                    The National Cyber Security Alliance has a good overview of multi-factor authentication and how it can be used to protect your business.
