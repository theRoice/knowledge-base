            <h2>Audits</h2>
            <p>
                Audits are one method to ensure that companies and organizations are following established procedures and guidelines.
                There are two forms of audits, internal and external, with each providing unique advantages and disadvantages. 
                Risk assessments are a critical component of audits, as they help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
                Audits are generally performed by certified bodies whether those are internal or external.
                Below are some general resources on audits:

            </p>
            
            <div id="internal-audits">
                <h2>Internal Audits</h2>
                <p>
                    These audits are performed by employees or consultants hired by the company. Generally these audits are performed
                    to ensure that the company is following established procedures and guidelines. Internal audits are generally less
                    expensive than external audits, but may not be as thorough and are potentially subject to bias.
                    Below are some general resources useful for internal audits:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.theiia.org/globalassets/documents/content/tools/iia-member-certified-cybersecurity-toolkit.pdf">IIA Cybersecurity Toolkit</a></li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="external-audits">
                <h2>External Audits</h2>
                <p>
                    These audits are performed by third-party companies or organizations. External audits tend to be more expensive than their internal counterparts.
                    External audits can be more thorough and extensive than internal audits. Being familiar with industry standards and regulatory law is key to 
                    preparing for audits. These can be found in more detail on our Compliance and Regulations <a href="ComplianceAndRegulations.html">page</a>.

            <div id="risk-assessment">
                <h2>Risk Assessments</h2>
                <p>
                    Risk assessments are critical components to audits. They help identify, analyze, and evaluate any potential threats and risks. These may be physical,
                    or digital in nature. By performing risk assessments organizations will better understand their vulnerabilities will be able to act to mitigate them.
                    Risk assessments are critical to ensure that data is protected, infrastructure is secure, and that industry standards and regulations are complied with.

        <div id="certifications">
            <h2>Certifications</h2>
            <p>
                Certifications are a way to demonstrate that an individual or organization has met a certain standard of knowledge or expertise.
                Certifiying bodies are third-party organizations that provide certifications. Some prominent cybersecurity certification bodies include:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://niccs.cisa.gov/education-training/cybersecurity-certifications">NICCS</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-overview/">SANS</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications">CompTIA</a></li>
