            <h1>Hardware and Infrastructure</h1>
            <p>
                This section will broadly cover the physical and digital components of security. Physical and digital
                security are intrinsically linked, as physical breaches can lead to digital breaches and vice versa.
                It is important to look at both aspects of security to ensure that your business is protected.

            <h2>Physical Security</h2>
            <p>
                Physical security is the means by which you protect your assets, to include hardware, networks, data,
                and personnel
                from physical actions. The most basic of these are deterrents such as locks, fences, cameras, and
                security personnel.
                The extent of these measures will largely depend on the needs of the business. For computers that have
                sensitive data,
                a business might consider placing these in a secure room with the addition of locking cases to prevent
                physical theft
                of the drives.

            <h2>Endpoint Security</h2>
            <p>
                Endpoints refer to any devices that connect to a network. This is commonly computers, laptops, tablets,
                and smartphones.
                Endpoint security is the means by which these devices are protected. Endpoint security to include
                antivirus software,
                firewalls, and encryption. Consistent updates are key to maintaining the security of these devices.

        <div id="firewalls" class="sub-content">
            <h2>Firewalls</h2>
            <p>
                Firewalls are a key component of network security. These serve as a barrier between your local network
                and the internet.
                Firewalls can implemented at the hardware or software levels. Hardware firewalls are physical devices
                that are placed between the
                network and the internet. Software firewalls are configurable programs installed on computers, routers,
                and servers. Firewalls
                can be configured to block or allow traffic based on a set of rules. They can also be configured to log
                traffic
                and alert administrators to potential threats.

        <div id="routers-switches" class="sub-content">
            <h2>Routers and Switches</h2>
            <p>
                Routers and switches are common physical components of a network. Routers are responsible for directing
                traffic between networks,
                while switches are responsible for directing traffic within a network. These both can be configured to
                block or allow traffic based on
                a rule set that fits required business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of wifi enabled routers, it is important to have a secure password enabled to prevent
                unauthorized access. Business's should
                assess the need for guest wifi networks and the security implications of these networks, as they can be
                a potential vector for attack.

        <div id="server-security" class="sub-content">
            <h2>Server Security</h2>
            <p>
                Servers can server many functions such as hosting websites, storing data, and running applications. To
                secure servers it is important to
                make sure they are up to date, are protected with strong passwords, and are stored in secure locations.
                Companies should also strive to
                limit access to servers to only those who need it.
            </p>

        <div id="iot-security" class="sub-content">
            <h2>Internet of Things Security</h2>
            <p>
                The Internet of Things (IoT) usually refers to any device connected to a network that is not a computer
                or smartphone. These devices can be
                printers, lights, thermostats, and much more. These devices can be vulnerable to attack if not properly
                secured. It is important to make sure
                that these devices are updated, have strong passwords, and are not accessible to unauthorized users.
