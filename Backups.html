            <h1>Backups</h1>
            <p>
                Backups are an essential component of any company that collects data of any type.
                These backups might include customer information, financcial records, company information,
                or any other data that is relevant to the company and its operations.

            <h2>Best Pracices</h2>
            <p>
                CISA recommends following what they call the 3-2-1 rule found (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf">here</a>). That is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep <b>3</b> copies of any important file: one of which is primary and two that are backups.</li>
                    <li>Keep the files on <b>2</b> different media types to protect agains different types of hazards.</li>
                    <li>Store <b>1</b> copy offsite.</li>
                </ul>

        <div id="backup-types">
            <h2>Backup Types</h2>
            <p>
                There are several different types of backups. The most common ones are:

                    <h3>Full Backup:</h3>
                    <p>
                        A complete copy of all data. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of backup. A full backup copies all selected data.
                        This takes up more storage space, and is slow to backup, but is the fastest to restore.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Incremental Backup: </h3>
                    <p>
                        Only copies data that has changed since the last backup. Incremental backups initially do a full backup. They then only copy changes made to the previous backup. 
                        These take up less space, and are fast to backup, but take longer to restore. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Differential Backup: </h3>
                    <p>
                        Only copies data that has changed since the last full backup. Differential backups are a mixture of the two. Differential also starts with
                        a full backup. It then copies all changes made since the last full backup. This takes up an amount of space between
                        full backups and incremental backups. It is moderately fast to backup and to restore.
                    </p>

        <div id="storage-media">
            <h2>Storage Media</h2>
            <p>
                There are several different types of storage media that can be used for backups. The most common ones are:
                <h3>Remote Backups (Cloud Storage)</h3>
                <p>
                    Remote backups are backups stored on a remote server. Often times, these servers are rented or loaned out. Common consumer
                    cloud storage services include Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive. The benefits of using remote storage offers
                    is protection from local incidents such as fires or floods. Additionally, data can be accessed anywhere that a user has
                    internet access, making it easy to backup and restore data. The downsides of remote storage is price, the potential to be locked
                    into a specific vendor, and lack of control over how your data is controlled and stored.
                </p>

                <h3>Internal Hard Drives</h3>
                <p>
                    Hard drives are a common storage medium for backups. They are relatively cheap and can store a large amount of data. Since backups
                    can be made locally this way, they can be used to quickly restore data. Unfortunately, hard drives are consumable and have the potential
                    to fail or become damaged, especially as the age. 
                </p>
                <h3>Removable Storage Media</h3>
                <p>
                    Removable storage media includes USB drives, CDs, and external hard drives. These are cheap and easy to use. They can be used to store 
                    data offline, and can be easily transported. Due to increased mobility, these can be lost, stolen, and can be damaged easily.
                </p>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="backup-frequency">
            <h2>Backup Frequency</h2>
            Backups should be done frequently, though "frequently" might mean different things depending on the business and the type of data being backed up.
            Critical data can be backed up daily, or even hourly. Less critical data can be backed up weekly or even monthly. Ultimately the frequency backups
            should be determined by the business and the policies it has decided to put in place.
        </div>

        <div id="disaster-recovery">
            <h2>Disaster Recovery Plans</h2>
            <p>
                Disaster recovery plans are a critical component of backups. These plans detail how a business will recover from a disaster, such as a fire, flood, or
                cyber attack. These plans should be tested regularly to ensure that they work as intended. These plans should be updated as the business changes and
                grows. These plans will also change depending on the chosen policy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="testing-backups">
            <h2>Testing Backups</h2>
            <p>
                Backups should be tested regularly to ensure that they work as intended. This can be done by restoring data from the backup and ensuring that it is
                accurate and complete. This can be done manually, or with the help of software. Testing is critical, as backups can become corrupted, go missing, or
                become outdated. Regular testing ensures data is ready to be restored in the event of a disaster.
